Q7-A number is called perfect if the sum of proper divisors of that number is equal to the number. For example 28 is perfect number,
since 1+2+4+7+14=28. Write a program to print all the perfect numbers in a given range.

def sumPdivisors(num):
    """
    Returns the sum of proper divisors of a number
    """
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, num):        
        if num % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    return sum(divisors)
def isPerfect(num):
    """
    Checks whether given number is perfect or not
    """
    return num == sumPdivisors(num)

def perfectNums(lower, upper):
    """
    Prints the all perfect numbers in given range
    """
    for i in range(lower, upper):
        if isPerfect(i):
            print(i)
            
perfectNums(0,100)
